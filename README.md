****CAMPUS CROWD MONITORING SYSTEM****

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

University students often face uncertainty and time loss due to unpredictable crowd congestion in places like mess halls, cafeterias, and libraries. With limited breaks between classes, students lack real-time visibility into crowd conditions and are forced to make inefficient decisions. Despite the availability of CCTV cameras on campuses, this data is rarely utilized to provide actionable insights. There is a need for a real-time, automated crowd monitoring system that helps students make smarter decisions by analyzing live camera feeds and presenting clear, understandable crowd information.
