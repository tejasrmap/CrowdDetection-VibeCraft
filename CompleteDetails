Campus Crowd Monitoring & Decision System


A real-time crowd monitoring system that uses computer vision on existing CCTV feeds to help university students make smarter decisions about when and where to go, based on live crowd conditions and behavioral patterns.


Problem Statement

University students often face uncertainty and time loss due to unpredictable crowd congestion in locations such as mess halls, cafeterias, and libraries. With limited breaks between classes, students lack real-time visibility into crowd conditions and are forced to make inefficient decisions. Although most campuses are equipped with CCTV cameras, this data is rarely utilized to provide actionable insights. There is a need for a real-time, automated system that analyzes live camera feeds and presents clear crowd information to students.
