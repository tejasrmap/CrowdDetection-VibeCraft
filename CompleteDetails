Campus Crowd Monitoring & Decision System

A real-time crowd monitoring system that leverages existing CCTV cameras and computer vision to help university students make smarter decisions about when and where to go, based on live crowd conditions and behavioral patterns.


🧩 Problem Statement


University students often face uncertainty and time loss due to unpredictable crowd congestion in places like mess halls, cafeterias, and libraries. With limited breaks between classes, students lack real-time visibility into crowd conditions and are forced to make inefficient decisions. Despite the presence of CCTV cameras on campuses, this data is rarely utilized to provide actionable insights. There is a need for a real-time, automated crowd monitoring system that analyzes live camera feeds and presents clear, understandable crowd information to students.


🎯 Solution Overview


This system:

Uses YOLO-based computer vision to detect and count people from live CCTV feeds

Classifies crowd levels as Low / Medium / High

Stores crowd data in a database for analysis

Displays real-time status and behavioral patterns through a student-friendly web dashboard

Helps students decide whether it is worth visiting a location at a given time


🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Computer Vision & AI

YOLOv8 – Real-time person detection

OpenCV – Video capture and frame processing

Backend

Python

Flask – REST API for serving live and historical data

MongoDB – Crowd data storage (location, people count, crowd level, timestamp)

Frontend

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Tools & Environment

Webcam / CCTV feed

VS Code

GitHub
